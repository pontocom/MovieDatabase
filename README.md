# MovieDatabase Application
A simple application developed in Android to demo the usage of external services (using a RESTful API) to search for movies and obtain detailed information about selected movies. This example, builds on top of what was achieved in the [MovieSearch application example][1], and introduces some more details, such as the usage of a complex **ListView**.

Please refer to the [MovieSearch application example][2] first, following the steps depicted there, and then continue to make the changes proposed here to extend its functionalities.

Go ahead to the step-by-step documentation.
